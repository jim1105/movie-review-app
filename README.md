Live support feature: When a user clicks on "join room" button, open another tag on your browser to sign in as admin to chat with the user. username: admin, password: admin. Live chat feature supports one to many simultaneous users (one tech support to many users). Run the app on three different tabs. Sign in as admin on one of the tabs, and sign in as users on rest of them. One of the users can hit "join room" to start a conversation with admin, and hit "leave room" to end a chat session when the conversation is over. After a user leaves a room, any users can hit "join room" to start a new chat session.
